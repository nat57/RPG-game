welcome to the city guard. I won't lie to you most everyone gets in as 
long as they can pick of a stick and knows the history of our crumbling nation.
as you all know this nation was quickly brought together from the reminants of the forces that opposed the 
increasingly oppressive growing class system the old great kingdom. because of our low ammount of strength 
and resources we currently only want to protect what we have and grow.
that brings me to our man rule here in the guard........ don't draw too much attention and get us into 
trouble with any other cities we dont have the supplies or man power.
(you hear some new recruits nearby wisper [damn that just makes us look like weaklings])
(you say anything outloud but you kind of agree)
now pair up and pick up your weapon its time to practice
