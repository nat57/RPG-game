through the day and night the sound of training guards can be heard.
there are barracks off in the distance where all the guards may sleep if they do not currently 
have money to get a room in an in or a house.
all offices controlling the operations of the guardsmen are off to the left
you currenly stand in the middle of the training area
(you think to yourself,)[I better decide what I want to do before I end up in someone's way]
